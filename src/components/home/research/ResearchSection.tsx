        "The idea that when you play role-playing games (RPGs): you submerge yourself 'in-game' to adventure, explore, and problem-solve through experimentation, puts your imagination, sense of self, and morality to the test. This paper explores RPGs as a distinct educational discipline that fosters critical thinking, creativity, and collaborative learning.",

      abstract:
        "The simple response would include that an 'authentic education' is designed to guide students to develop their unique talents and abilities, rather than forcing them to conform to standardized measures. This paper examines the philosophical foundations of authentic education and its implications for modern pedagogy.",

      abstract:
        "Current education systems were invented over a hundred years ago to meet the needs of the industrial revolution. This paper argues that the future of education lies in converging multiple pedagogical approaches to meet the diverse needs of 21st-century learners, emphasizing personalization, interdisciplinary learning, and real-world application.",

      abstract:
        "By the end of the 20th century, concerns over students' dependency, self-doubt, demotivation, and anxiety had reached critical levels. This paper examines Self-Determination Theory and argues against the overuse of extrinsic motivators in educational settings, advocating for intrinsic motivation through autonomy, competence, and relatedness.",
